#Â Simon's dotfiles

**DEPRECATED: I've now switched to using https://github.com/simonrw/macos-nix-config for my configuration**

The traditional dotfiles repository.

## Installation of configs

This project (currently) uses Ruby's Rakefile system, so `gem install rake`. The tasks can be listed with `bundle exec rake -T`, but these consist of `install` and `uninstall`.

``` sh
rake deploy                    # Synchronises the repositories
rake install[install_osx]      # Links the respective files into the correct places
rake uninstall[uninstall_osx]  # Removes any soft-links created by this script
```

Configurations are installed with soft links. Each directory contained within this one is linked to the home directory but a '.' is prepended to hide it, e.g. zsh/zshrc gets linked to ~/.zshrc.

Anyway with these repos the installation method is not the most key thing; the configurations themselves are more interesting. The main repos (which receive the most attention) are zsh and vim, in fact the vim subdir changes almost daily.

Vim plugins are managed by [neobundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim), and zsh files are split up by what they handle.

## OSX

If you're running OSX the osx directory contains some nice defaults which I use. To install them add an argument to the `install` task. The argument could be anything; I haven't worked out how to add arguments properly yet.
