# General

* I use ripgrep (rg) not grep

# Rust

* Do not assume the `target` dir for built outputs. I have a custom path set with `$CARGO_TARGET_DIR` so debug builds are under `$CARGO_TARGET_DIR/debug`, documentation is under `$CARGO_TARGET_DIR/docs` etc.
* Do not assume `~/.cargo` for the cargo registry files. I have a custom path set with `$CSARGO_HOME`.
